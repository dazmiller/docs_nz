# Introduction

Welcome to the NoHassls API. You can use our API to access NoHassls API endpoints, which can provide information on lead prospects, requests, and insurance demands from customers, check your current billing, stats and other amazing things.

We have language bindings in Shell, PHP, and Javascript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This documentation is organised to mimic the workflow of making a NoHassls API request.

The first step is to query for any new insurance profiles (QuoteRequest Object). These are the details of an insurance request made by a customer. This contains all the details they have supplied, allowing an anonymous insurance quotation to be provided. This does not contain any identifying information about the client.

Pinnacle Life will return a QuoteReply Object that contains information about the quote. This includes data such as the cost per month, annual cost, product details, availability and other data concerning the quote.

A notification is then sent to the user that the Pinnacle quotation has been supplied and is available for scrutiny. 

If the customer decides to accept the quotation, then a ContactRequest object will be added to the Pinnacle ContactRequestQueue API notifying you that a customer wishes to be contacted.  The ContactRequest Object object will contain the preferred contact time and date supplied by the customer and any additional questions or information.

Pinnacle Life will create a ContactReply Object and post it to the ContactReplyQueue. The customer will then be notifed that the time slot requested is available and Pinnacle are ready to contact them.

The customer agrres to release his/her private information to Pinnacle and a CustomerProfileObject will be added to the CustomerProfileQueue for retrieval by Pinnacle Life.


The CustomerProfileObject will contain the ID of the original Insurance Pofile, the ID of the Pinnacle profile response and the ID of the User Profile record. A UserProfile record will contain the users contact information, name, address and any other private information including email address and telephone number.



Pinnacle Life now have all the information required to initiate contact with the customer and continue the application process.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'NoHassls'

api = NoHassls::APIClient.authorize!('PINNACLE-KEY')
```

```php
import NoHassls

api = NoHassls.authorize('PINNACLE-KEY')
```

```Javascript
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: PINNACLE-KEY"
```

> Make sure to replace `PINNACLE-KEY` with your API key.

NoHassls uses API keys to allow access to the API. These keys are generated and maintained by the NoHassls Development Team. For more information about your key please visit our [developer portal](http://developers.nohassls.co.nz).

NoHassls expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: PINNACLE-KEY`

Any request that does not contain this key will be refused with a 403 FORBIDDEN return code.
<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>PINNACLE-KEY</code> with your Pinnacle API key.
